# Valorant Elo Tracker
This project is simply meant to provide a application for competitive players to get a better representaion of their rank!
## Open Source
This is an open source project, however please read the license before making any personal changes. 
## Code
The code is sloppy... I know. Dont judge, but feel free to make a pull request cleaning some things up!
## Saftey and concerns
I know it can be scary typing in your username and password, but there is no reason to worry, the only request that is making it away from your computer is the api reuqest. No other information is passed away from the application!
## Contact
The easiest way to contact me is through my [Discord](https://discord.gg/6asqQtNWca). Im happy to take any requests you have for the application, or I can troubleshoot if for some reason you cant get it to run properly!
